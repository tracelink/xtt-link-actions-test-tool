# TraceLink XTT Link Actions Test Tool

The XTT Link Action Test Tool is a tool used to execute Link Actions in a localized environment (e.g. through the [XTT Link Actions Sandbox](https://github.com/tracelink/xtt-link-actions-sandbox)) and validate their functionality through defined test procedures. The tool provides feedback in the form of success / fail messages during script execution with matching results added to the configuration files.

Link Actions provide a generic, extensible framework for direct, automated
communication between external systems and TraceLink’s Multienterprise
Information Network Tower (MINT) solution. A Link Action consists of three
parts:
* JavaScript to make API calls to or from an external system.
* Transform to map the data to or from TraceLink’s required canonical formats.
* Configuration parameters to connect to the external system.

The XTT Link Actions Test Tool is used in conjunction with the [XTT Link Actions Sandbox](https://github.com/tracelink/xtt-link-actions-sandbox) to run
the Link Actions locally. These two tool make up the XTT Link
Actions Developer Kit.
